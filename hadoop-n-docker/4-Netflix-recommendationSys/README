This project was originated from the NetFlix competition in building a recommendation system.

Given datasets include:
    1. {user, watched_movie, rating} records. 
    2. {moviesID: movieTitle} database.

OK. Model: Item-based Collaboritive Filtering. 
    Why this model? We have more users than movies. We need to shrink the matrix size as much as possible.

Here is what we do:

1. Use users' watch history to generate co-occurrence matrix. 
    why? Co-occurrence matrix is part of the model that measures the similarity between movies according to users' ratings.

2. Use users' ratings to calculate the likelihood that a user will watch a movie.
    How? 

    Likelihood that a user who only watched movie1, will like to watch movieX = movie1_ratings * movie1_movieX_co-occurrence / sum(movieX_occurrence)
    
    Looping over the users' watch history, you will get a overall likelihood that the user will like to watch movieX.
