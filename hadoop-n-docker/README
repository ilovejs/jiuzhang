This dir contains the hadoop exercise files and instructions I used.

I only tested these on my localhost instead of using docker to create multiple virtual containers because:

1. my old mac CPU doesn't support virtualization.
2. there isn't enough memory to support running hadoop job if i set up a virtual machine with VirtualBox. In addition, I tried it on Ubuntu but it always always run into the problem described at: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ConnectionRefused
